### About me:
I'm a software engineering student from UU.
I love :
- Commiting to open source projects
- Building cool stuff.
- Tinkering around my Arch Installation
- Linux.
- Simplicity.

Below is the list of stuff I have worked/am working on:
  - [Violet](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Violet) - Voilet is a Lightweight RESP database server. To interact with Violet, you'll need a compatible client - that's where Red comes in. You can find the [Red]([Red](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Red)) client below.
  - [Red](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Red) - Red is a client CLI for Violet supporting the complete RESP protocol.
  - [Gencrest](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Gencrest) -  Image Generator using steepest ascent hill climbing with logarithmic decay.
  - [Puck](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Puck) - A dynamically typed language with its own interpreter
  - [2who_communication](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/2Who_Communication) - A chatting Client - Server application that I made after taking inspiration from IRC chatrooms.
  - [WebServer](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/WebServer) - A simple webServer, it just sends some message to the client. Ofcourse the client is going to be your Webbrowser. 
  - [SpaceInvaders](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Space_Invaders) - The remake of the classic Space Invaders game but unlike the classic version, you can move freely but there's no place to hide.

...and many more
