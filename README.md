### About me:
I'm a software engineering student from UU.
I love :
- Exploring how things work.
- Building cool stuff.
- Tinkering around my Arch Installation
- Linux.
- Simplicity.


Below is the list of stuff I have worked/am working on:
  - [Puck](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Puck) - A dynamically typed language with its own interpreter
  - [2who_communication](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/2Who_Communication) - A chatting Client - Server application that I made after taking inspiration from IRC chatrooms.
  - [WebServer](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/WebServer) - A simple webServer, it just sends some message to the client. Ofcourse the client is going to be your Webbrowser. 
  - [SpaceInvaders](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Space_Invaders) - The remake of the classic Space Invaders game but unlike the classic version, you can move freely but there's no place to hide.
  - [Violet](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Violet) - Voilet is my own implementation of [REDIS](https://redis.io/about/). This is just a server. In order to run it, you need it's client too. That is [Red](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Red) you can find it below. 
  - [Red](https://github.com/Probatio-Diabolica/Red) - Red is a Redis CLI implementation supporting the complete RESP protocol.

...and many more
